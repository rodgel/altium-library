The ProASICPLUS family of devices, Actel’s second generation Flash FPGAs, offers enhanced performance over Actel’s ProASIC family. It combines the advantages of ASICs with the benefits of programmable devices through nonvolatile Flash technology. This enables engineers to create highdensity systems using existing ASIC or FPGA design flows and tools. In addition, the ProASICPLUS family offers a unique clock conditioning circuit based on two on-board phase-locked loops (PLLs). The family offers up to 1 million system gates, supported with up to 198kbits of 2-port SRAM and up to 712 user I/Os, all providing 50 MHz PCI performance.
